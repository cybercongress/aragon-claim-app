The Vesting app is used to vest your cyber~Foundation tokens until the end of cyber~Auction. It is also used to claim an equivalent, 1-to-1, amount of tokens in the Cyber blockchain (if the foundation tokens are vested). 

Your tokens will be locked for transfer for the duration of the auction. But, are available to be used for participating in the governance of the DAO.

After the end of the auction and the finalization of the distribution, the tokens will be unlocked for transfer. From this point onwards, cyber~Congress will no longer be responsible for their transfer.

## Features:
- Vest and lock user tokens for transfers, until a set date
